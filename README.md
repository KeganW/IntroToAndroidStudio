README

PURPOSE: Make small projects using Android Studio. While projects won't be complex,
the goal is to learn the basics and get comfortable with this IDE.

MOTIVATION: I definitely want to start exploring mobile development, and will be 
taking a course on this next quarter! I hope that building small apps will help
me get more experience so I could make a larger, more complex one next quarter 
in a group setting.
